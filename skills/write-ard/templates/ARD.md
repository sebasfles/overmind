# Architecture and Debt Record

Global decisions, as a dated log, and the index of debt across modules.
Module-level decisions live in `modules/{{module}}/ard.md`.

## Decisions

{{entries, newest last}}

## Debt index

Open debt only: an entry with `Resolved by` leaves the table.
Rebuilt by `write-ard` on every run, kept current by `document-task` on every task.

| Module | Date | Debt | Revisit when |
|---|---|---|---|
| {{module}} | {{date}} | {{one line}} | {{trigger}} |
